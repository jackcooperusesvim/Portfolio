# LeetCode SQL

This section is more of a collection of some code snippets. I have saved my answers for two of my favorite LeetCode SQL50 problems, as well as the original prompts which they were written to answer. I did these problems in preparation for an interview using PL/SQL, so that is the flavor I used.

To look through this project, just exit less and search through the subdirectories. The filenames should be fairly self-explainatory.
