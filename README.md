# Andre Fontenele Portfolio

This is a small collection of some of the things I have programmed over the past year. Each directory contains one project (in a git repo), notated by "nameofthelanguageused_projectname".

To look into any of the projects, all you need to do is change into the directory and make that directory.

For example, to check out the "CoopGo" project, all you need to do is this:
cd CoopGo && make

The directories which do not contain fully runnable and testable code will have guidance on reading the code instead.

# List of Projects

## CRUD App (Go)
I wanted to build our local Homeschool Co-op a better website, because the Treasurer (my Mom), had inherited a horrenous Excel workbook for a database and would pull her hair for hours to change one field on one record. The project didn't work out for people reasons, but I did learn a lot about Web Development from it. My favorite part of the project (and the part I am most proud of) was the hand-rolled Auth and the largely custom CSRF protection.

## Mancala AI (Rust)
I wanted to learn Rust (for reasons I don't want to tell all of GitHub), and this was one of my first mini-projects in the language. It is a simple AI I built for playing the game Mancala, and while I doesn't have a UI yet, I am quite proud of it.

## Machine Learning Library (Rust) (WIP)
This is the project I am currently working on. In an effort to study current Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI algorithms, I started this project to re-implement all popular Machine Learning algorithms, starting with a Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits (using the MNIST dataset).

## MonkeyType Analysis (Python)
This entry in the portfolio is done but not presentable yet due to some of the annoyances of using Python virtual enviorments with Git version control.
