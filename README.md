# Andre Fontenele Portfolio

This is a small collection of some of the things I have programmed over the past year. Each directory contains one project (in a git repo), notated by "nameofthelanguageused_projectname".

To look into any of the projects, all you need to do is change into the directory and make that directory.

For example, to check out the "go_webapp" project, all you need to do is this:
cd go_webapp && make

The directories which do not contain fully runnable and testable code will have guidance on reading the code instead.

# List of Projects

## CRUD App | GO|
I wanted to build our local Homeschool Co-op a better website, because the Treasurer (my Mom), had inherited a horrenous Excel workbook for a database and would pull her hair for hours to change one field on one record. The project didn't work out for people reasons, but I did learn a lot about Web Development from it.

## Mancala AI | Rust |
I wanted to learn Rust (for reasons I don't want to tell GitHub), and this was one of my first mini-projects. It is a simple AI I built for playing the game Mancala, and while I doesn't have a UI yet, I am quite proud of it.

## CURRENT Machine Learning Library | Rust |
This is the project I am currently working on. In an effort to study current Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI algorithms, I started this project to re-implement all popular Machine Learning algorithms, starting with a Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits (using the MNIST dataset).
